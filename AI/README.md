# Machine Learning Documentation for OURepository

## Prerequisites

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Install [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#tensorflow-object-detection-api-installation).

In `scripts/__init__.py`, reconfigure the root directory for all output if desired.

## Preliminary steps for training and inference:

Because we are running scripts that import from sibling directories, we must use the _executable module_ way of 
running scripts. All the following commands should be run from the AI directory.

1. Run `python -m test.generate_test_img` to generate the test dataset.
1. Run `python -m scripts.preprocessing.crop` to generate image slices and convert to TFRecords.
1. Run `python -m scripts.model_main_tf2` to start the training process.
1. From the command line, run `tensorboard --logdir=models/$model_uuid` to view training statistics. 
   For example, `tensorboard --logdir=models/test`. It may take a bit 
   of time for statistics to become available. Training can be stopped when loss reaches an asymptote. Early 
   stopping needs to be implemented, or num_steps must be defined.
1. Run `python -m scripts.exporter_main_v2` to export the model.
1. Evaluation can be performed using either a Tensorflow SavedModel or a Checkpoint. We will use SavedModel. Run 
   `python -m scripts.evaluation.inference`. This output a single image with all predicted annotations overlaid on 
   top. Also, a CSV for each category with the predictions will be outputted.
   
In the `crop.py` and `inference.py` scripts, it can be configured to show a matplotlib plot for each slice. See 
`visualization_utils.py` for more details. The current configuration of matplotlib may cause issues if run from the  
command line.
   
Please look at the referenced files for more details on program arguments. By default, it will run on a test dataset.

## Outputted files

All output is organized on the highest level by the model UUID.

The `annotations` directory contains the label map and TFRecords for each model, organized by model UUID.  
The `pre-trained-models` directory contains all downloaded models (unpacked) and an `archives` directory with the 
tar.gz of each downloaded model.  
The `models` directory contains the model data for user-trained models, organized by model UUID.  
The `exported-models` directory contains the user-trained models that have been exported, organized by model UUID.
The `inferences` directory contains all inferences performed by a model. Each inference makes a new directory from the 
image name that contains the image with detection on top, and a CSV for the bounding boxes for each label the model 
was trained on. Organization is by model UUID then image name.

## Troubleshooting


## Troubleshooting

Issues may arise related to HDF5 if rasterio is imported before Tensorflow. Take note importing files that import 
either of these packages.
